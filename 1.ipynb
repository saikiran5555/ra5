    "Elastic Net Regression is a regression technique that combines the properties of both Ridge Regression and Lasso Regression. It is particularly useful when dealing with datasets having multiple correlated features. Elastic Net aims to overcome some of the limitations of Lasso and Ridge when used individually, especially in scenarios involving highly correlated predictors or when the number of predictors is much larger than the number of observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Characteristics of Elastic Net Regression:\n",
    "Combination of L1 and L2 Regularization: Elastic Net incorporates both the L1 (used in Lasso Regression) and L2 (used in Ridge Regression) regularization terms. The L1 part encourages sparsity (setting some coefficients to zero), while the L2 part encourages the shrinking of coefficients (but not exactly to zero).\n",
    "\n",
    "Tuning Parameters: Elastic Net has two tuning parameters, α (alpha) and λ (lambda).\n",
    "\n",
    "α (Alpha): This parameter balances the contribution of L1 and L2 regularization in the model. A value of α close to 1 makes the penalty function similar to Lasso, while α close to 0 makes it similar to Ridge.\n",
    "λ (Lambda): This is the regularization parameter that controls the overall strength of the penalty, similar to the lambda in Lasso and Ridge.\n",
    "Differences from Other Regression Techniques:\n",
    "Versus Ordinary Least Squares (OLS): Like Lasso and Ridge, Elastic Net adds regularization terms to the OLS loss function, which helps to prevent overfitting and handle multicollinearity. OLS does not have this feature and can result in overfit models, especially with many predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Versus Lasso (L1): While Lasso uses only the L1 penalty, leading to sparsity but potentially struggling with multicollinearity and variable selection when the number of predictors is large, Elastic Net overcomes this by combining L1 with L2, making it more robust in such scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "Versus Ridge (L2): Ridge Regression uses only L2 penalty, which shrinks coefficients but does not set them to zero, possibly leading to models that are not sparse. Elastic Net includes the L1 penalty, which helps in achieving sparsity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages of Elastic Net Regression:\n",
    "Handling Correlated Features: Elastic Net can handle the case of correlated features more effectively than Lasso or Ridge alone.\n",
    "Model Selection: It can select groups of correlated variables, whereas Lasso might pick only one variable from a group and ignore the others.\n",
    "Stability: The inclusion of both penalties makes Elastic Net more stable than Lasso in scenarios where the number of predictors is much larger than the number of observations or when several predictors are highly correlated.\n",
    "Limitations:\n",
    "Complexity in Tuning: Having two parameters to tune (α and λ) can make Elastic Net more complex to implement and optimize compared to Lasso or Ridge, which have only one tuning parameter.\n",
    "Computational Cost: The combination of two penalties can make Elastic Net computationally more intensive than either Lasso or Ridge."
